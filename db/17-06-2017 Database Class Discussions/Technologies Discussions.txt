Programming Languages:-

-->Programming languages provide raw materials.
--->Programming languages provides syntaxes and symantics for
software development.
---> C, C++, Java, C# and etc..... are programming languages.

Software Technologies:-

--->Software technologies provides rules and guidelines.
--->Software technologies are non installable s/w. But the 
softwares developed by using software technologies are 
installable.
---> ASP.Net, Servlets, JDBC, JSP and etc are software 
technologies.

Types of software technologies:-

There are two types of software technologies:-

1. Open Source Technologies:- The Open source technologies
are open for all software vendors to develop software 
applications. All java software technologies are open source.

2. Proprioriterary Technologies:- The Technologies which are
closed for all software vendors are proprioriterary 
technologies. All .Net Technologies are closed technologies.

Frameworks:- Frameworks are installable softwares. By using
frameworks you can develop the application softwares rapidly.
The framework take care of common logics.

---> If you work with software technologies then you write
common logics and application specific logics.
---> If you work with frameworks then you write only application
specific logics. The framework take care of common logics.

E.g.:- MVC 5.2 , MVC 6.0 , Spring, Hibernate, Struts, JSf and
etc are frameworks.
